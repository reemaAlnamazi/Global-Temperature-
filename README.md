# Global-Temperature-
Climate change has become one of the most critical issues of our time, and understanding long-term temperature patterns is essential for analyzing how the planet is warming. This project focuses on exploring global, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, and zonal temperature datasets collected over more than a century. The goal is to clean, merge, and analyze these datasets to uncover meaningful trends and build predictive models that estimate future temperature anomalies.
Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, the report demonstrates a full end-to-end Data Science workflow. The findings highlight clear patterns of rising global temperature anomalies and provide insights into the historical and predicted behavior of Earth’s climate.
